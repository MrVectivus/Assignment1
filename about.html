        <h2>About us</h2>
        <div class="aboutUs">
            Since 1997, we have been contributing absolutely nothing to society through terrible games!<br>
            By secretly planting games that have nothing to do education, we strive to give the facade of an enriched learning experience for teachers,
            just as the famous coolmathgames, which indeed has no games related to math!<br>
